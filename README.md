# ABC inc. #
ABC incorporated is brought to you by Aileen O'Brien, Brett Goss, & Cecia Poders. Three perfect strangers, who came together under the Lighthouse Labs umbrella to bring you this monochromatic jewel of a MapApp.


# [MAPPIN](https://mappin-maps.herokuapp.com/)â„¢ #
MAPPIN is your new favorite tool for creating and saving custom maps!

_BENEFITS:_

View custom lists curated by our allstar clients and developers!
Users have the ability to create custom maps for whatever they choose! Eateries, sites, landmarks, parks, schools, businesses, friends, the sky's the limit! (Or the sea, depending how you map.)

_FEATURES:_

Add, edit, and remove points on a map. Save your maps to your user profile, so you can review, reminise, and share. For example: You're going on a trip! Make a custom map of landmarks and cafes to visit during the day, and another map for shows and restaurants at night! 

_Never Lost, Merely Mappin._
